        <h1>How to use online banking</h1>
        <p><img class="rns" src="images/bankLogin.png">We use online banking to check our current account (and Dad's current account), set up and revise standing orders and to make payments, known as 'transfers'. This page explains how to access online facilities.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Go to the <a href="https://www.barclays.co.uk">Barclays web site</a>.</li>
          <li>Log in. I chose to use my debit card number, since that is the easiest to find.</li>
          <li>At the PIN Sentry page enter the last five digits of your card number, put your card into the PIN Sentry device and follow the instructions.</li>
        </ul>
        <p style="clear: both;"><img class="rns" src="images/pinSentry.png">You may then be asked to chose an account. Since you only have one it may take you directly to our account. When on the account page you can scroll down to see the transactions and make payments, view/add/amend standing orders, etc..</p>
