        <h1>How to use Apps on the iPad</h1>
        <p>Apps is short for Applications, otherwise known a programs. On the iMac you can have several applications running at the same time, each in a different window on the screen. You can move the windows around on the screen and resize them so that you can see them all, or you can click in a partially covered window so as to bring it to the front.</p>
        <p>On the iPad, however, although several applications can be running at the same time, you can only see one of them, since their 'window' fills the screen. By double clicking the Home button you can see all the applications that are currently running. You can then tap one to make it visible. If you want to refer to one of the other applications, then you repeat the process.</p>
